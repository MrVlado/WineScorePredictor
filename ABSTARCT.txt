Wine classification

DATASET -> Wine Quality Data Set(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol



OUTPUT
A real number ranged in (0:10) that indicataes the quality





TO DO
-Choose the alghoitms (Grid search k-fold cross validation for parameter selection will be applied for every alghoritm tested)
    -SVM (with different kernels)
        -POLY
        -RADIAL
        -SIGMOIDAL
    - N 
        

-Normalize the dataset(every feature between 0:1) AT LEAST FOR SVM
